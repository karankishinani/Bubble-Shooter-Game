# Bubble-Shooter-Game
Bubble Shooter Game made using GUI for Turbo C/C++

## Note:
```
1. The main program is “BUBBLE.C”
2. This program is designed to execute using Borland Turbo C/C++ in the DOS enviornment.
```

## Objective
To apply the arrays data structures and graphical mode in problem solving using Programming Language C.

## Description of the Game
This is a program with a game of bubbles. This game consists of eliminating bubbles of the same color that form a group of three or more bubbles. The bubbles form a triangle in the center of the top of the window, starting with 10 bubbles and going down discounting in one until you reach the tip of the triangle with a bubble. Use four colors for randomly generated bubbles. The group of bubbles are eliminated when hit with a bubble of the same color, remember that they must be three or more to be eliminated, if you hit a bubble of the same color now has two bubbles in the line; the goal is to clear all bubbles. Score random color scores of 100, 500, 200 and 1000. Each time bubbles are removed, the score is accrued according to the color. If you have a score of 10,000 to 19,999 you get a star, from 20,000 to 50,000 two stars and more than 50,000 three stars.
The plays can only be vertical and diagonal, if the user chooses vertical, should enter the column and if you want to play diagonal enters the number of the row and if you want to the left or right. At random a bubble must be generated at the base of the triangle, which, when struck, knocks down all the missing ones. The screen should always present the score that is getting the player and the stars he is reaching.
